  abstract = {The affordability and availability of water and energy have a huge impact on food production. Research has shown that there exists a direct and indirect link between power production and clean water generation. Hence the inclusion/importance given to the energy-water-food (EWF) nexus in the United Nations' sustainable development goals. Acknowledging the importance of decarbonization to the global future, there exists a gap in literature on the development of models that can enhance the EWF nexus, reduce energy poverty, and achieve 100\% renewable energy in the electricity sector. Therefore, the technical and economic prospect of geothermal energy for bridging the aforementioned gaps in existing works of literature is presented in this study. The energy poverty/wealthy status of a country has been confirmed to have a significant impact on economic development, as economic development is largely reflected in the food-water availability. Ditto, this study is focused on the interconnectivity of the EWF nexus while incorporating global decarbonization targets. Geothermal energy is of the utmost significance in East Africa due to its abundant potential and distinctive geological features. Located in the Great Rift Valley, the region has an abundance of geothermal reservoirs, making it an ideal location for geothermal power generation. This study is novel as a comprehensive assessment framework for energy poverty is developed and innovative models utilizing primarily the geothermal resource in the East African region to mitigate this problem are proposed and analyzed. The role of hydrogen generation from critical excess electricity production is also analyzed. The East Africa region is considered the case study for implementing the models developed. A central renewable energy grid is proposed/modelled to meet the energy demand for seven East African countries namely; Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, Djibouti, Comoros, Eritrea, and Rwanda. This study considers 2030, 2040, and 2050 as the timestamp for the implementation of the proposed models. The hybrid mix of the biomass power plant, solar photovoltaic (PV), pumped hydro storage system and onshore wind power is considered to furthermore show the potency of renewable energy resources in this region. Results showed that the use of geothermal energy to meet energy demands in the case study will mitigate energy poverty and enhance the region's EWF.},

Due to variation in benefit schemes across the regions and within regions across months, we can identify the effect of changes in future benefits on adoption. We combine and compare three distinct and widely used future benefit schemes for PV, namely output-based, capacity-based and electricity cost saving-based. We find that PV adoption in the residential sector is highly sensitive to overall net-benefits and that the different benefit schemes have varying degrees of effectiveness. In particular, capacity- and output-based benefit schemes, which directly compensate households with a fixed price per produced electricity or per installed capacity annually (direct benefits), respectively, are above 60\% more effective than the electricity cost saving-based scheme, which depends on future electricity prices (indirect benefits). Furthermore, depending on the specific benefit scheme, the average newly installed capacity can either increase or decrease.},

In order to optimally plan a future energy system, it is necessary to consider the influence of several sectors as well as the interaction of the transmission grid and distribution grid. The concept of Feasible Operation Region (FOR) is a detailed approach to representing the operational dependencies between the transmission and distribution grid. However, in previous planning procedures, only a simplified expansion of the distribution grids can be taken into account. With the method presented in this paper, a Feasible Planning Region (FPR) is developed, which represents the operational boundaries of the distribution grids for several expansion stages and thus represents an admissible solution space for the planning of distribution grids in systemic planning approaches. It hence enables a more detailed representation of the necessary distribution grid expansion for the integration of distributed technologies in an optimized energy system of the future. In this paper, we present the method by which the FPR is formed and its integration into an energy system planning formulation. In the results, the FPR is presented for different voltage levels, and its use in power system planning is demonstrated.},

Using a utility maximization model, I simulate the optimal share of electricity consumption that households should buy forward for a sample of 2,159 UK households. I investigate the impact of price elasticity of demand and risk aversion on optimal hedge shares. The key finding is that an increase in price elasticity either raises or lowers optimal hedge shares, depending on the sign of the correlation between electricity prices and households' weatherrelated desire to consume electricity. Simulations reveal an average optimal hedge share of 59\%, with higher shares for electric heating and electric vehicle owners and lower shares for solar PV and battery storage owners. Forward hedging significantly reduces monthly electricity bill volatility by 19\% for relatively price-inelastic households. However, welfare gains from optimal forward hedging are modest, translating to only a 0.3\% reduction in average electricity prices.},

The feasibility criteria chosen by the authors are important, but are also easily addressed at low economic cost, while not affecting the main conclusions of the reviewed studies and certainly not affecting their technical feasibility. A more thorough review reveals that all of the issues have already been addressed in the engineering and modelling literature. Nuclear power, which the authors have evaluated positively elsewhere, faces other, genuine feasibility problems, such as the finiteness of uranium resources and a reliance on unproven technologies in the medium- to long-term. Energy systems based on renewables, on the other hand, are not only feasible, but already economically viable and decreasing in cost every year.},

While the global reliance on SWRO plants for water security increases, there is no consensus on how the capital costs of SWRO plants will vary in the future. The aim of this paper is to analyze the past trends of the SWRO capital expenditures (capex) as the historic global cumulative online SWRO capacity increases, based on the learning curve concept. The SWRO capex learning curve is found based on 4,237 plants that came online from 1977 to 2015. A learning rate of 15\% is determined, implying that the SWRO capex reduced by 15\% when the cumulative capacity was doubled. Based on SWRO capacity annual growth rates of 10\% and 20\%, by 2030, the global average capex of SWRO plants is found to fall to 1,580 USD/(m3/d) and 1,340 USD/(m3/d), respectively. A learning curve for SWRO capital costs has not been presented previously. This research highlights the potential for decrease in SWRO capex with the increase in installation of SWRO plants and the value of the learning curve approach to estimate future SWRO capex.},

Saudi Arabia can achieve 100\% renewable energy power system by 2040 while meeting increasing water demand through seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) and multiple effect distillation (MED) desalination plants. The dominating renewable energy sources are PV single-axis tracking and wind power plants with 243 GW and 83 GW, respectively. The levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) of the 2040 system is 49 \texteuro/MWh and decreases to 41 \texteuro/MWh by 2050. Corresponding levelised cost of water (LCOW) is found to be 0.8 \texteuro/m3 and 0.6 \texteuro/m3. PV single-axis tracking dominates the power sector. By 2050 solar PV accounts for 79\% of total electricity generation. Battery storage accounts for 41\% of total electricity demand. In the integrated scenario, due to flexibility provided by SWRO plants, there is a reduced demand for battery storage and power-to-gas (PtG) plants as well as a reduction in curtailment. Thus, the annual levelised costs of the integrated scenario is found to be 1\textendash 3\% less than the non-integrated scenario.},

It is found that the global desalination demand by 2050 can be reduced as much as 30\% and 60\%, depending on the irrigation efficiency growth rate. India, China, USA, Pakistan and Iran account for between 56\% and 62\% of the global desalination demand. Decarbonising the desalination sector by 2050, will result in global average levelised cost of water decreasing from about 2.4 \texteuro/m3 in 2015, considering unsubsidised fossil fuel costs, to approximately 1.05 \texteuro/m3 by 2050, with most regions in the cost range of 0.32 \texteuro/m3 \textendash{} 1.66 \texteuro/m3. Low-cost renewable electricity, in particular solar photovoltaics and battery storage, is found to form the backbone of a sustainable and clean global water supply, supported by measures to increase irrigation efficiency. The results show the untapped relationships between the irrigation and decarbonised desalination sector that can be utilised to strengthen the global water supply for the decades to come and meet United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.},

Ports' readiness for hydrogen export and import are reviewed from perspectives of infrastructure, risk management, public acceptance, regulations and standards, and education and training. The main findings are: (1) liquid hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, and LOHCs are suitable forms for hydrogen international trade; (2) twenty ports are identified that could be first movers; among them, twelve are exporting ports, and eight are importing ports; (3) ports' readiness for hydrogen international trade is still in its infancy, and the infrastructure construction or renovation, risk management measures, establishment of regulations and standards, education and training all require further efforts.},

In this paper, we provide quantitative estimates for the benefits and costs of an intercontinental HVDC grid connecting a number of highly populated super regions in the Northern Hemisphere. The modeling is based on hourly time series of wind and solar power generation calculated from high-resolution global weather data using the Global Renewable Energy Atlas. Taking a European point of view, we find that the annual need for backup energy can be reduced from 18 to 10 \% of the load by connecting to North Africa, the Middle East and Russia. A further reduction to 7 \% is found for a grid spanning the whole Northern Hemisphere at the expense of substantial increase in transmission capacities. Comparing the economical benefits to the additional cost of intercontinental transmission lines, we estimate that connecting Europe to its geographically nearest neighbors may reduce the total cost of electricity. Longer distance connections to North America or Asia, on the other hand, would require transmission costs to fall to 15\textendash 20 \% of current levels.},

Industrial clusters can be defined as geographical areas with a high density of energy-intensive industries and material interconnections, requiring guaranteed supply of energy and resources. The energy transport infrastructure providing this is under continuous re-assessment in order to answer changing spatial and temporal needs in supply and demand due to the energy transition, the integration of renewables and the consequences of disruptive events threatening global energy systems. Adjustments to the transnational electrical infrastructure and product backbones (natural gas, hydrogen, etc.), through expansion or repurposing, are necessary to maintain the security of energy supply; in particular for industrial clusters as they inform future energy strategies and technology innovation.},

Given ample access to seawater and scarce freshwater resources, such regions make the direct and selective electrolytic splitting of seawater into molecular hydrogen and oxygen a potentially attractive technology. The key catalytic challenge consists of the competition between anodic chlorine chemistry and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This Perspective addresses some aspects related to direct seawater electrolyzers equipped with selective OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts. Starting from a historical background to the most recent achievements, it will provide insights into the current state and future perspectives of the topic.

  title = {Welfare Redistribution through Different Flexibility Deployment Strategies - {{Who}} Pays?},
  author = {Emelianova, Polina and Namockel, Nils},
  abstract = {Achieving the goal of climate neutrality calls for a decarbonization of end-use sectors. Hereby, the primary strategy is electrification of end-use applications for heating and transportation. In particular Germany has defined specific technology targets for the year 2030. The increased penetration of new technologies such as electric vehicles and heat pumps, has far-reaching implications for the energy system, notably influencing the formation of electricity prices. Moreover, the distinct behavioral constraints associated with various flexibility options disrupt the existing equilibrium between consumer and producer rents. This paper aims to address the following research questions: What is the impact of different flexibility deployment strategies on producer and consumer rents? To what extend do households have to be compensated to provide systemoriented flexibility? To address these questions, we further enhance the existing electricity market model DIMENSION. First, we develop a high-resolution dispatch model for Europe. Second, we increase the granularity in end-use sectors to account for flexible use of electric vehicles, including Vehicle-to-Grid/Building (V2X), heat pumps and heat storage. Doing so, electricity costs can be assigned to the individual actors, allowing an analysis of technology-specific welfare effects. We find that additional deployment of flexibility lowers the total system cost. Furthermore, we show that different flexibility deployment strategies impact technology-specific consumer and producer rents. For example, while the end-user procurement costs can be lowered by utilizing flexible charging, the costs do not decrease further by providing V2X services. As increase in consumer rents might not be sufficient to offset investment costs required to deploy flexibility, financial incentive schemes might be needed to unlock flexibility potential.},

  abstract = {The energy transition is a major challenge that knows no borders and requires a systematic change in the energy production, consumption and transport. These challenges can be effectively tackled only through collaborative efforts. Accordingly, to simplify cooperation and increase transparency for policy and technical decision makers, researchers around the world are developing open modeling tools. However, due to the high complexity, the modeling tools are often tailored to specific problems using regional-specific data and focusing on few countries. Consequently, contributions are often scattered and highly inflexible, leading to duplication of work, missed collaborations, and inefficiencies. The recent PyPSA - Earth model is a promising tool that enables energy system modeling with flexible spatial and temporal resolution. Until now, it has only been validated for Nigeria and Africa, hence lacking proof of Earth coverage. In this study, we extend the PyPSA-Earth methodology to enable energy modeling for nearly every country on Earth. Novel data cleaning, merging and modeling tasks have been performed to reach global coverage. Results confirm that PyPSA-Earth now covers approximately 99\% of the world's population and can generate high-resolution datasets for national energy studies. This work lays the foundations for future endeavors in flexible energy modeling of arbitrarily large regions.},

  abstract = {Achieving carbon neutrality is probably one of the most important challenges of the 21st century for our societies. Part of the solution to this challenge is to leverage renewable energies. However, these energy sources are often located far away from places that need the energy, and their availability is intermittent, which makes them challenging to work with. In this paper, we build upon the concept of Remote Renewable Energy Hubs (RREHs), which are hubs located at remote places with abundant renewable energy sources whose purpose is to produce carbon-neutral synthetic fuels. More precisely, we model and study the Energy Supply Chain (ESC) that would be required to provide a constant source of carbon-neutral synthetic methane, also called e-NG, in Belgium from an RREH located in Morocco. To be carbon neutral, a synthetic fuel has to be produced from existing carbon dioxide (CO2) that needs to be captured using either Direct Air Capture (DAC) or Post Combustion Carbon Capture (PCCC). In this work, we detail the impact of three different carbon sourcing configurations on the price of the delivered e-NG. Our results show that PCCC is the most competitive from a cost perspective, and that e-NG could be delivered to Belgium at a price of 136\texteuro/MWh when using existing CO2 sources in Morocco. For comparison, this price is less than half of the one of regular fossil natural gas delivered in Belgium at the peak of the 2022 energy crisis in Europe.},

  abstract = {Ammonia is a key chemical for the agriculture and chemical industries, and a potential future marine fuel. Potential growth in ammonia demand further highlights the importance of ammonia production defossilisation to comply with climate goals. Widely available renewable resources and declining costs of solar photovoltaics and wind power enable the production of green e-ammonia at many locations and potential exports to countries with less optimal resources and other restrictions. This paper aims to compare the cost of imported e-ammonia to Germany, Finland, and Spain from regions with excellent renewable resources, Morocco and Chile, to the cost of local production, and to quantify potential economic savings due to trading. Transportation costs are calculated in this study with techno-economic parameters reported in detail to assess their impact on final import costs, and to allow comparison of shipping costs to pipeline transmission costs over various distances. Pipeline imports from Morocco were found to be significantly higher in cost compared to imports by sea from Chile and Morocco or local production. Imports from Chile were found to be economically feasible for Germany and Finland, with import costs 10\textendash 33\% lower than domestic e-ammonia production in 2030\textendash 2050. Imports to Spain may be attractive in 2030s, but, after 2040, local solar resources enable local e-ammonia production costs at the same or lower cost as imported e-ammonia. Ammonia trading in the future may depend on access to the sea. Other factors such as creation of jobs, additional revenues, and energy security concerns may also impact e-ammonia trade.},

  abstract = {Government support for green technologies and renewable energy (RE) in particular has become an integral cornerstone of economic policy for most industrialized economies. Due to competitive price determination and supposedly higher efficiency, auctions have in recent years widely succeeded feed-intariffs (FITs) as the primary support instrument (del Rio \& Linares, 2014; REN21, 2021). However, literature still struggles to produce causal evidence to validate mostly descriptive findings for efficiency gains. Yet, this evidence is needed as a foundation to provide robust recommendations to policy makers (Grashof et al., 2020). By utilizing a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach, this paper provides such evidence for a German photovoltaic (PV) auctioning program which came into effect in 2015. Results for this natural experiment confirm that cost-effectiveness improved significantly while previous literature shows that capacity expansion remained high. Results additionally show that falling prices for PV panels were the primary driver of cost reductions and wages also exert high influence on support price. Input cost development therefore indeed strongly influences support level which was the aim with introducing competitive auctions. Interest rate development cannot be linked to support level development, most probably due to the low interest environment in considered period.},

  abstract = {Widespread adoption of hydrogen as an energy carrier is commonly believed to require continued advances in power-to-gas (PtG) technologies. Here we provide a comprehensive assessment of the dynamics of system prices and conversion efficiency for three currently prevalent PtG technologies: alkaline, polymer electrolyte membrane, and solid oxide cell electrolysis. We analyze global data points for system prices, energy consumption, and the cumulative installed capacity for each technology. Our regression results establish that over the past two decades every doubling of cumulative installed capacity resulted in system prices coming down by 14\textendash 17\%, while the energy required for electrolysis was reduced by 2\%. On the basis of multiple forecasts of future deployment growth, as well as policy and industry targets, our calculations project that all three technologies will become substantially cheaper and more energy-efficient in the coming decade. Specifically, the life-cycle cost of electrolytic hydrogen production is projected to fall in the range of \$1.6\textendash 1.9 per kg by 2030, thereby approaching but not reaching the \$1.0 per kg cost target set by the U.S. Department of Energy.},

  abstract = {As the stock of battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) is growing at increasing speed, new questions emerge when it comes to the sustainability of the electrification of the passenger road transport sector. As electrifying the whole vehicle fleet might bring adverse effects in terms of mineral resource use, a reduction of the overall car fleet size might be needed. Electric carsharing has the potential to speed up the electrification of the passenger car fleet while decreasing its size. Yet, it could also reduce the flexibility potential of BEVs in the power system. In this paper, we use an open-source power sector model (DIETERpy) and an open-source vehicle time series tool (emobpy) to study the impacts of electric carsharing on the power sector in Germany in 2030, assuming a future power system highly t dominated by renewable energy sources (RES). In order to overcome computational challenges related to including detailed BEV time series in a power system model, we apply sequence clustering techniques to derive representative car user statistics and identify users that are most likely to switch to carsharing in the mid-term. Our results show that switching to electric carsharing moderately increases costs in a flexibility-constrained power sector. This cost f effect is largely mitigated when considering more realistic settings taking into account other sources of flexibility. We conclude that electric carsharing does not hurt the power sector much but potentially brings along many other benefits.},

  abstract = {Import and export of fossil energy carriers are cornerstones of energy systems world-wide. If energy systems are to become climate neutral and sustainable, fossil carriers need to be substituted with carbon neutral alternatives or electrified if possible. We investigate synthetic chemical energy carriers, hydrogen, methane, methanol, ammonia and Fischer-Tropsch fuels, produced using electricity from Renewable Energy Source (RES) as fossil substitutes. RES potentials are obtained from GIS-analysis and hourly resolved time-series are derived using reanalysis weather data. We model the sourcing of feedstock chemicals, synthesis and transport along nine different Energy Supply Chains to Germany and compare import options for seven locations around the world against each other and with domestically sourced alternatives on the basis of their respective cost per unit of hydrogen and energy delivered. We find that for each type of chemical energy carrier, there is an import option with lower costs compared to domestic production in Germany. No single exporting country or energy carrier has a unique cost advantage, since for each energy carrier and country there are cost-competitive alternatives. This allows exporter and infrastructure decisions to be made based on other criteria than energy and cost. The lowest cost means for importing of energy and hydrogen are by hydrogen pipeline from Denmark, Spain and Western Asia and Northern Africa starting at 36 EUR/MWhLHV to 42 EUR/MWhLHV or 1.0 EUR/kgH2 to 1.3 EUR/kgH2 (in 2050, assuming 5\% p.a. capital cost). For complex energy carriers derived from hydrogen like methane, ammonia, methanol or Fischer-Tropsch fuels, imports from Argentina by ship to Germany are lower cost than closer exporters in the European Union or Western Asia and Northern Africa. For meeting hydrogen demand, direct hydrogen imports are more attractive than indirect routes using methane, methanol or ammonia imports and subsequent decomposition to hydrogen because of high capital investment costs and energetic losses of the indirect routes. We make our model and data available under open licenses for adaptation and reuse.},

  abstract = {Day-ahead electricity markets are organized as combinatorial auctions where producers and consumers can trade power for each hour of the next day simultaneously instead of hour by hour. In Europe, this is possible through bids on blocks of multiple rather than just individual hours. However, the many possible combinations of hours make the decision space exponentially large and the bidding decision complex. This inherent bidding complexity of combinatorial auctions poses a fundamental problem: an efficient allocation can only be achieved if each individual is able to truly reflect their preferences through their bids. In this paper, we show how agents can overcome this complexity by using price information. To this end, we exploit total unimodularity to present a linear program to determine an exclusive group of bids. Moreover, we link the quality of these bids to the available price information measured by the Wasserstein distance. We demonstrate the efficiency of this bidding approach on three cases studies of a thermal generator, a battery storage and a district heating utility selling and buying electricity on the German day-ahead market. Finally, we use these theoretical and empirical results to inform the policy debate around the design of bid formats on day-ahead markets.},

  abstract = {Recently, increasing fossil fuel prices have led to substantial windfall profits for energy companies. Thereby, little is known how firms utilize cash windfall in the energy market. This paper examines the impact of cash windfall on investment behavior in power markets. In practice, it is challenging to empirically distinguish between cash windfall and profit from firm performance. We exploit extreme temperature as a novel instrument for two-stage instrumental variable regression to isolate cash windfall from firm profit and to show how power plants utilize cash windfall. We uses rich data on investment in power generation assets from the U.S. power market between 2008 and 2021. We contribute by exploring (i) how firms change their investment behavior in the presence of cash windfall and (ii) if this investment is directed towards improved environmental performance. We find that higher temperature increases plant revenue, which leads to a significant increase in total capital expenditures and environmental performance.},

  abstract = {The daily, seasonal, and interannual variability of solar and wind resources is well-documented, based on evidence from multi-decadal meteorological time series. However, with the growing share of non-dispatchable renewable-based power sources (e.g., wind and solar power), the stable operation of the power system could be undermined by prolonged periods of low availability of these resources. Consequently, this may result in extremely high prices in the energy market or even a power system blackout. This study analyzes the performance of solar, wind, and solar-wind hybrid systems in Europe based on eight regional climate models, considering two possible climate change projections. The resource availability has been evaluated based on the energy drought concept. The total duration of droughts is calculated using daily capacity factors covering the years 1970\textendash 2020 (reference period) and 2048\textendash 2098 (future period), considering sub-national regions across the whole of Europe. In general, the chosen climate models show a more significant agreement in the occurrence of energy droughts for northern and southern Europe compared to its central part. Assessing the potential for renewable energy droughts is critical to maintaining secure and reliable power system operation in both the present and future climate.},

It assesses the conditions at which solar Photovoltaics (PV) and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) would be competitive with a grid (mainly fossil) driven desalination plant for the reference year and by 2030. The paper considers also a scenario where battery storage complements PV power generation. To conduct the analysis, a simple model of water cost calculation is built. Second, the cost related to energy consumption is calculated for different power supply options to evaluate the impact of energy provision cost on the final cost of water. The first main result of this paper is that desalinated water can be obtained at an acceptable cost of around 1 \$/m3. The second one is that PV without storage remains the cheapest power supply option today and by 2030. Storage based solution appears less competitive today but can be more attractive in a framework of increasing electricity grid prices and higher flexibility requirements in the future. The paper gives recommendations regarding the implication of different technology choices in the framework of the future Moroccan energy system.},

  abstract = {The use of green hydrogen can support the decarbonization of sectors which are difficult to electrify, such as industry or heavy transport. Yet, the wider power sector effects of providing green hydrogen are not well understood so far. We use an open-source electricity sector model to investigate potential power sector interactions of three alternative supply chains for green hydrogen in Germany in the year 2030. We distinguish between model settings in which Germany is modeled as an electric island versus embedded in an interconnected system with its neighboring countries, as well as settings with and without technology-specific capacity bounds on wind energy. The findings suggest that large-scale hydrogen storage can provide valuable flexibility to the power system in settings with high renewable energy shares. These benefits are more pronounced in the absence of flexibility from geographical balancing. We further find that the effects of green hydrogen production on the optimal generation portfolio strongly depend on the model assumptions regarding capacity expansion potentials. We also identify a potential distributional effect of green hydrogen production at the expense of other electricity consumers, of which policy makers should be aware.},

In this study, we evaluate the potential of self-sufficient energy supply for 41 million freestanding single-family buildings under current and future (2050) conditions. We identify 4,000 representative buildings, calculate weather-robust cost-minimal energy systems, and transfer the optimization results to the entire European building stock. Our analyses show that buildings in regions with low seasonality and high electricity procurement costs have a high potential for self-sufficiency. Under current techno-economic conditions, 53\% of the 41 million buildings are technically able to supply themselves independently from external infrastructures by only using local rooftop solar irradiation, and this proportion could increase to 75\% by 2050. By paying a premium of up to 50\% compared with grid-dependent systems with electrified heat supplies, building owners could make over two million buildings fully energy self-sufficient by 2050.},

However, developing long-term investment plans is a challenging task, complicated by the volatility of energy markets and the uncertainties induced in the policy landscape by the recent energy crises. In this respect, mathematical models can support the transition of industrial systems, steering the planning process. In this work, we review and evaluate the suitability of available models to serve this purpose. The availability of modelling tools for local energy planning has already been assessed by several works. However, the tools which are most frequently employed at this scale are generally unable to characterise the evolution of the energy system in the long term, they have a focus on the operational aspects of the system, and are, in many cases, proprietary. By contrast, all the models examined in this review are open source, and the investigated set also features tools able to capture long-term dynamics. Our results provide evidence that several tools could offer valuable insights to the planning process. Nevertheless, a trade-off between the representation of long-term dynamics and the modelling of key aspects of the energy system of a company is, to date, inevitable. The best compromise is offered by a small group of multi-scale tools, able to conjugate a long-term perspective with a detailed modelling of the operational aspects of the system.},

  abstract = {All over the world, agriculture is both the food provider and an energy-intensive consumer, basically in developing countries. Thus, energy inputs into agriculture are often from fossil origin. Nevertheless, rural development cannot be done without food security and energy independence. In line with this target, it is proposed that energy from biomass could achieve sustainability, especially in rural areas where poverty and scarcity of energy raised continually. To this end, a techno-economic analysis is progressively developed to examine the opportunity of biomass power generation to furnish clean electricity for rural areas in Morocco. The purpose of this effective work is to valorize the untapped potential of agricultural biomass waste, aiming to achieve rural sustainability and reach a stable electricity supply. For this aim, a case study was drawn at the strategic geographical region Fes-Meknes, which possesses a particular agricultural potential of 4.22 million tons, equivalent to over 0.5 Mtep/year. Performance results showed that only with olive residues, the selected power systems has the potential, of about 2828.11\,GWh/year with an annual capacity factor of 82.5\%. The system power generated in 8761\,h per year can supply electricity to 254,252 households. Indeed, to compensate monthly variations of electricity load and demand, the energy produced is assumed to be supplied to the national grid, and from there, recovered by the local villages. The main results of the financial model can be perceived as a total installed cost of 3755.70 \$/kW. The average real and nominal LCOE of 17.23 and 15.03 cents/kWh respectively, which is exceptionally competitive to solar concentrated technology and fossil resources. Moreover, this work carried both sensitivity and parametric studies to evidence key operating and financial parameters with the most influential effect on the performance indexes. Besides, the results properly show that performance variables depend strongly on flue gas temperature and the LCOE is exceedingly sensitive to feedstock price and finance rates.},

  abstract = {CO2 emission reduction of sectors such as aviation, maritime shipping, road haulage and chemicals production is challenging, but necessary. Although these sectors will most likely continue to rely on carbonaceous energy carriers\textemdash especially for long-range aviation and chemicals\textemdash they are expected to gradually shift away from fossil fuels. In order to do so the prominent option is to utilize alternative carbon sources\textemdash like biomass and CO2 originating from carbon capture\textemdash for the production of non-fossil carbonaceous vectors (biofuels and e-fuels/RFNBOs). However, the limited availability of biomass and the varying nature of other carbon sources, necessitate a comprehensive evaluation of trade-offs between potential carbon uses and existing sources. This study utilizes the linear programming cost optimization tool Energyscope TD, to analyze the holistic French energy system, encompassing transport, industry, electricity, and heat sectors, while ensuring net greenhouse gas neutrality. We introduce a novel method to model and quantify carbon flows within the system, enabling a comprehensive assessment of greenhouse gas neutrality. Additionally, we perform a sensitivity analysis on biomass use and availability and carbon sequestration availability. The findings underscore the critical role of efficient carbon and energy valorization from biomass, offering valuable insights into the future cost of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production for air travel originating from France but also on chemicals cost. Furthermore, our study highlights the significance of fulfilling clean energy requirements and implementing carbon dioxide removal measures as crucial steps toward achieving climate neutrality.},

  abstract = {The integration of electricity markets through increased interconnection capacity is a key driver of their economic performance. However, its impact on the environmental and market values of renewable energies, which are simultaneously being heavily deployed, must be measured. We empirically estimate this impact for the case of the connection between France and Spain, which was doubled in 2015. We find that this doubling has reduced the domestic marginal CO2 abatement effect of Spanish wind power but has increased the reduction in emissions in France due to it. However, this increase does not fully offset the domestic decrease. Regarding the price effect, we find that Spanish wind power has a downward impact on French prices, and this effect is even more pronounced after the increase in interconnection capacity. This study underscores the intricate interplay between market integration, renewable energy deployment, and environmental outcomes. It highlights the need for systematic assessments of the environmental and economic benefits associated with the integration of European price zones, especially in the context of countries with varying degrees of polluting generation. The implications extend beyond the France-Spain case, offering insights into the ongoing transformation of European electricity markets.},

  author = {Rahmad, Yodefia},
  abstract = {Wind power often diffuses unevenly across a country, despite uniform policy instruments and electricity prices. Understanding where and how wind power has historically been deployed can help inform future development of wind power and consequently the feasibility of national targets. In this paper, we investigated deployment of onshore wind power in Swedish municipalities over the last 30 years. We identified factors that affect spatial heterogeneity in wind deployment using statistical analysis and examined the common features of municipalities with the highest levels of deployment. Our analysis found that onshore wind power in Sweden has increased both in unit capacity and number of units in a single wind park. Smaller wind power projects were deployed at lower rate compared to larger projects and have saturated since 2010. Municipalities with high share of agricultural land use and longer time since initial deployment have higher installed capacity of small-scale wind power projects, highlighting the importance of suitable land cover and accumulation of experience over the years. On the other hand, municipalities with a high share of prioritized area for wind power have deployed more large-scale wind power projects, indicating the relevance of siting recommendations from regulatory authorities for more recent deployment. Land constraints such as population density and nature reserves do not have significant effect on deployment of either scale of wind power projects. Additionally, we found that municipalities with highest installed capacity of large-scale projects consistently have a high amount of forested land and exhibit a range of acceptable wind speeds. We also observed that high levels of deployment are typically achieved by a few large projects without any precursors. Our research demonstrates the necessity to distinguish between different scales of wind power projects when analyzing historical deployment, due to the different mechanisms at play. This approach can serve as a useful framework for examining subnational deployment of wind power, particularly when upscaling occurs or when other changes are introduced to the technology.},

Instead of a 40 percent target, greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced by 50 to 55 percent compared to 1990 levels; the European Parliament is even considering a 65-percent reduction. The European Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) sectors should make an appropriate contribution to this reduction. However, decisive for limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as in accordance with the Paris Agreement, is compliance with a consistent emissions budget, the total amount of cumulative greenhouse gas emissions. For the EU ETS, compliance with an emissions budget requires adjusting the emission cap. This Weekly Report derives the minimum requirement for emission reductions in the EU ETS sectors in line with a globally cost-effective emissions budget. The results show the cap must be urgently adjusted to ensure the minimum European contribution to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Otherwise, beginning in 2030, drastic measures will be necessary to reduce emissions. At the same time, national coal phase-out plans and a more ambitious European energy policy make it possible to approximate the cost-effective pathway by adjusting the cap, without additional reduction requirements for the EU ETS sectors.},

  author = {Ruhnau, Oliver and Schiele, Johanna},
  year = {2022},
  institution = {{ZBW - Leibniz Information Centre for Economics}},
  abstract = {Electrolytic hydrogen complements renewable energy in many net-zero energy scenarios. In these long-term scenarios with full decarbonization, the ``greenness'' of hydrogen is without question. In current energy systems, however, the ramp-up of hydrogen production may cause additional emissions. To avoid this potential adverse effect, recently proposed EU regulation defines strict requirements for electrolytic hydrogen to qualify as green: electrolyzers must run on additional renewable generation, which is produced in a temporally and geographically congruent manner. Focusing on the temporal dimension, this paper argues in favor of a more flexible definition of green hydrogen, which keeps the additionality criterion on a yearly basis but allows for dispatch optimization on a market basis within that period. We develop a model that optimizes dispatch and investment of a wind-hydrogen system\textemdash including wind turbines, hydrogen electrolysis, and hydrogen storage\textemdash and apply the model to a German case study based on data from 2017-2021. Contrasting different regulatory conditions, we show that a flexible definition of green hydrogen can reduce costs without additional power sector emissions. By contrast, requiring simultaneity implies that a rational investor would build a much larger wind turbine, hydrogen electrolyzer, and hydrogen storage than needed. This leads to additional costs, underutilized resources, and a potential slow-down of green hydrogen deployment. We discuss that current trends in the energy transition are likely to amplify the economic and environmental benefits of a flexible definition of green hydrogen and recommend this as the way forward for a sustainable hydrogen policy.},

Thus, the industry must make substantial changes as part of the global energy transition toward a carbon-neutral society. Green hydrogen has the potential to boost the transition to clean and renewable energy while providing stability and reliability to power grids. This work reviews the most recent developments of Power-to-Hydrogen-to-Power (P2H2P) systems: conversion of power to hydrogen, its storage, transport, and re-electrification, with emphasis on their technical characteristics, novel modeling approaches, and implementation challenges. The main opportunities to exploit the potential of P2H2P are associated with cost efficiency and innovation, sector coupling, and reduction of grid dependence. In such a way, P2H2P systems would become cost-competitive while decarbonizing sectors. Furthermore, the gradual maturity of technology and political support would encourage the development of sustainable energies for zero-emission economies.},

  abstract = {In the context of 100\% renewable electricity systems, prolonged periods with persistently scarce supply from wind and solar resources have received increasing academic and political attention. This article explores how such scarcity periods relate to energy storage requirements. To this end, we contrast results from a time series analysis with those from a system cost optimization model, based on a German 100\% renewable case study using 35 years of hourly time series data. While our time series analysis supports previous findings that periods with persistently scarce supply last no longer than two weeks, we find that the maximum energy deficit occurs over a much longer period of nine weeks. This is because multiple scarce periods can closely follow each other. When considering storage losses and charging limitations, the period defining storage requirements extends over as much as 12 weeks. For this longer period, the cost-optimal storage capacity is about three times larger compared to the energy deficit of the scarcest two weeks. Adding other sources of flexibility for the example of bioenergy, the duration of period that defines storage requirements lengthens to more than one year. When optimizing system costs based on single years rather than a multi-year time series, we find substantial inter-annual variation in storage requirements with the most extreme year needing more than twice as much storage as the average year. We conclude that focusing on short-duration extreme events or single years can lead to an underestimation of storage requirements and costs of a 100 \% renewable system.},

  abstract = {In many net-zero energy scenarios, electrolytic hydrogen is a key component to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors and to provide flexibility to the power sector. In current energy systems that are not yet fully decarbonized, however, the hydrogen ramp-up raises the concern of increasing power sector emissions. To avoid such additional emissions, recent EU regulation defines requirements for electrolytic hydrogen to qualify as green along three dimensions: the additionality, the proximity, and the simultaneity of renewable electricity generation. Focusing on the temporal dimension, this article investigates the effects of a strict hourly simultaneity requirement, full temporal flexibility, as well as simultaneity exemptions in the current EU regulation. We develop a model of a renewables-hydrogen project, consisting of individual wind turbines, solar panels, hydrogen electrolysis, and hydrogen storage. As a novelty, the model optimizes not only dispatch but also investment decisions, and we expose it to different regulatory conditions. We show that a flexible definition of green hydrogen does not necessarily increase power sector emissions. By contrast, requiring hourly simultaneity implies that rational investors build much larger wind turbines, hydrogen electrolyzers, and hydrogen storage than needed\textemdash meaning additional costs and embedded carbon, underutilized assets, and a potential slow-down of green hydrogen deployment. These adverse effects can only partially be mitigated by including solar panels and by the EU simultaneity exceptions. We argue that current energy transition trends further lower the risk of increasing power sector emissions under a flexible definition of green hydrogen and recommend this as the way forward for a sustainable hydrogen policy.},

  abstract = {To combat climate change, it is anticipated that in the coming years countries around the world will adopt more stringent policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase the use of clean energy sources. These policies will also affect the industry sector, which means that industrial production is likely to progressively shift from CO2-emitting fossil fuel sources to renewable energy sources. As a result, a region's renewable energy resources could become an increasingly important factor in determining where energy-intensive industries locate their production. We refer to this pull factor as the ``renewables pull'' effect. Renewables pull could lead to the relocation of some industrial production as a consequence of regional differences in the marginal cost of renewable energy sources. In this paper, we introduce the concept of renewables pull and explain why its importance is likely to increase in the future. Using the examples of direct reduced iron (DRI) and ammonia production, we find that the future costs of climate-neutral production of certain products is likely to vary considerably between regions with different renewable energy resources. However, we also identify the fact that many other factors in addition to energy costs determine the decisions that companies make in term of location, leaving room for further research to better understand the future relevance of renewables pull.},

Morocco serves as a blueprint for countries aiming to design their energy systems along these two dimensions, risking technology lock-in, unabated local energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, rising local energy prices, land use implications and neo-colonialism. Extending the current state of research, we conduct an integrated analysis of synergies and con icts between these two objectives, taking into account the potential impact of hydrogen exports on economic bene ts for both local populations and hydrogen exporters. We present a fully sector-coupled capacity expansion and dispatch model of Morocco across 53 regions, including integrated gas pipeline and electricity network planning based on PyPSA-Earth. e applied sector-coupled model simulates and optimises the Moroccan energy system in more than 100 scenarios at a 3-hourly temporal resolution, sweeping through di erent hydrogen export volumes and climate targets. Results show that hydrogen exports could provide signi cant economic bene ts for both hydrogen exporters and the local population, but also create potential con icts and rising electricity and hydrogen prices. In addition, potential risks of neo-colonialism highlight the need for an integrated assessment of hydrogen exports and local decarbonisation. Integrated policies unlock synergies and minimise potential con icts between hydrogen exports and Morocco's energy transition, while ensuring social and environmental sustainability.},

This paper delves into citizens' participation in energy cooperatives, focusing on the profile of current members, as well as identifying which social groups are still underrepresented in energy cooperatives today. The analysis combines insights from two data sources. First, an online survey of around 1,500 members of two energy cooperatives in Flanders and around 1,500 non-cooperative members. Second, exclusive pseudonymized transaction data of residential consumers of a large Belgian bank, BNP Paribas Fortis (BNPPF). By examining socio-demographics such as gender, age, income, wealth, and the willingness and ability to invest, profiles of cooperative members and non-cooperative members are obtained. In addition, the analysis of socio-demographics in relation to investment patterns uncovers noteworthy trends and enables the grouping of individuals based on their characteristics. Furthermore, by assessing the willingness and ability to invest, valuable insights can be gained regarding the overall potential of these cooperatives. Identifying the profile types of cooperative members serves as a necessary first step in the realisation of the vision of the EU to provide renewable energy for all citizens. It allows policymakers to implement measures that extend access to energy cooperatives and their renewable energy production, particularly for lower-income groups who remain excluded from such front running initiatives. Given the opportunities in this field, research plays a crucial role in comprehending the socio-economic aspects of energy cooperatives and their investors, guiding policy decisions, and developing innovative solutions to overcome barriers.},

OMOD uses a data-driven approach, calibrated with household travel survey data, to generate a population of agents with detailed daily activity schedules that state what activities each agent plans to conduct, where, and for how long. The temporal aspect of the output is wholly disaggregated, while the spatial aspect is given on the level of individual buildings. In contrast to other existing models, OMOD is freely available, open-source, works out-of-the-box, can be applied to anywhere in Germany with the ambition to widen the scope to other countries, and only requires freely available OpenStreetMap (OSM) data from the user. With OMOD, it is easy for non-experts to create realistic mobility demand, which can be used in transportation studies, energy system modeling, communications system research, et cetera. This paper describes OMOD's architecture and validates the model for three cities ranging from 200,000 to 2.5 million inhabitants.},

  abstract = {The technological solutions for the basic materials industry's transformation towards climate neutrality are known. Green technology deployment, however, has still not occurred at scale and remains below socially optimal levels. Analysing the means by which the regulator should align private investment conditions with social welfare, we formulate an analytical model to assess the optimal policy intervention when a carbon price is in place to internalise emissions externalities, but additional market failures are present. With our paper, we aim to a) structure the instrument design debate for the industry transformation, b) systematically bring risk considerations of the regulator into the picture and c) inform how design features of proposed instruments affect the risk-return profile of both regulator and producer. For each of the considered market failure scenarios, we consider an output subsidy as a strictly revenue-increasing intervention, as well as a carbon contract and a green lead market instrument as interventions with both a revenue-increasing and a risk-reducing policy component. In the base case with positive technology externalities from green production, we find that risk should not be transferred away from the producer and onto the public when the producer has the means to efficiently hedge on private future markets. Introducing incomplete future markets as a second market failure on top of the base scenario, we derive that the optimal policy intervention depends on the risk aversion of the regulator and the producer. Consequently, the social planner should aim to allocate carbon price or revenue risk to the actor that shows the lower risk aversion. Thirdly, we analyse the case of information asymmetries between the regulator and the producer. More specifically, we assume that the regulator does not observe the producer's hedging efficiency. While the initial findings from the base model hold, we show for this case that risk-transferring policy interventions can prevent information rents on risk components that are transferred to the public.},

One such challenge is for policymakers to ensure a sustainable future for the environment including freshwater and land resources while facilitating low-carbon hydrogen production using renewable wind and solar energy. We establish a country-by-country reference scenario for hydrogen demand in 2050 and compare it with land and water availability. Our analysis highlights countries that will be constrained by domestic natural resources to achieve electrolytic hydrogen self-sufficiency in a net-zero target. Depending on land allocation for the installation of solar panels or wind turbines, less than 50\% of hydrogen demand in 2050 could be met through a local production without land or water scarcity. Our findings identify potential importers and exporters of hydrogen or, conversely, exporters or importers of industries that would rely on electrolytic hydrogen. The abundance of land and water resources in Southern and Central-East Africa, West Africa, South America, Canada, and Australia make these countries potential leaders in hydrogen export.},

However, state-of-the-art electrolysis requires support from associated processes such as desalination of water sources, further purification of desalinated water, and transportation of water, which often contribute financial and energy costs. One strategy to avoid these operations is to develop electrolysers that are capable of operating with impure water feeds directly. Here we review recent developments in electrode materials/catalysts for water electrolysis using low-grade and saline water, a significantly more abundant resource worldwide compared to potable water. We address the associated challenges in design of electrolysers, and discuss future potential approaches that may yield highly active and selective materials for water electrolysis in the presence of common impurities such as metal ions, chloride and bio-organisms.},

  author = {Tries, C and Hofmann, F and Brown, T},
  abstract = {In wind- and solar-dominated energy systems it has been assumed that there are synergies between producing electricity and electrolytic hydrogen since electrolysis can use excess electricity that would otherwise be curtailed. However, it remains unclear whether these synergies hold true at higher levels of hydrogen demand and how they compare with benefits of off-grid, islanded hydrogen production, such as better renewable resources and cost savings on electronics due to relaxed power quality standards. Using a mathematical model across two geographical locations for Germany, Spain, Australia, and Great Britain, we explore trade-offs and synergies between integrated and islanded electrolysers. Below a certain threshold, between 5\% and 40\% hydrogen share depending on the country, integrated electrolysers offer synergies in flexibility and reduced curtailment. Above these thresholds, islanded electrolysers become more favourable. Without cost advantages, systems including islanded electrolysers in Germany achieve up to 21\% lower hydrogen costs than systems with only integrated electrolysers. With 25\% island cost advantage, this benefit rises to 40\% lower hydrogen costs. Our study identifies three investment regimes with country-specific transition points that vary based on island cost advantages and each country's renewable resources. Based on our results we provide guidelines for countries considering how to deploy electrolysers.},

Using multi-objective optimization, minimizing both costs and life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, we find the Pareto boundary for this case study. We compare this ex-ante setup to a prior ex-post life cycle assessment, and furthermore dive into sensitivities of our model regarding battery lifetimes. We find (i) low-hanging fruit in lowering emissions with manageable cost increases of \$0.02/MWh to decrease the carbon intensity by 1kg CO2e/MWh, (ii) ex-ante life cycle assessments' possibility to find less-GHG intensive power systems compared to ex-post conducted studies, (iii) a heavy sensitivity of the optimization model on assumed battery lifetimes. This study shows the importance of including life cycle CO2e emissions into the optimization objective of energy system models to see the environmental and economic trade-offs associated with off-grid RES-based energy systems.},

  author = {Zuch, Matteo},
  abstract = {Carbon capture and storage (CCS) constitutes a key technology to achieve emissions reduction targets and mitigate climate change. However, the effective implementation and large-scale deployment of CCS crucially depend on public support and preferences for such low-carbon energy technologies. Based on nationally representative household survey data and detailed geospatial information at the individual level, this paper investigates the effect of geographical characteristics of existing energy infrastructure on people's willingness to pay (WTP) for CCS in Denmark. The stated preference study applies two CCS-specific valuation scenarios involving annual emission reductions of 5 and 10 million tons (Mt) of CO2, respectively. The empirical findings indicate different dynamics in the relationship between people's spatial exposure to distinct energy systems and their WTP for CCS, depending on the scope of the underlying CCS-related emissions reduction scenario. Specifically, living in an area with a high density of renewable energy sources, i.e., wind turbines, negatively affects people's WTP, especially considering CCS with smaller CO2 reductions. Exposure to polluting industries and energy plants positively and significantly influences the WTP for CSS only in the 10Mt CO2 reduction scenario. Furthermore, the findings suggest prompted information spillover effects regarding the distance to existing gas storage facilities and WTP for large-scale CCS deployment: Informed respondents living close to operating gas storage facilities exhibit significantly stronger preferences for CCS deployment than their non-informed counterparts. The study highlights important socio-economic and geographical factors relevant to the efficient development of CCS projects. The findings can inform policymakers in designing and implementing socially acceptable CCS deployment strategies, promoting the socio-technical low-carbon energy transition.},
