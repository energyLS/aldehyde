\subsection{Moroccan energy model}
Here I describe the application of PyPSA-Earth \cite{Parzen2022} to Morocco and the sector extension.
\subsubsection{Emission targets}
The emission targets of Morocco are: xx in 2030 and xx in 2050
\subsubsection{Green hydrogen}
Which definition will I use and how is it implemented?
\subsection{Islanded hydrogen production}
\subsection{Integrated hydrogen production}

This refers to \ref{sec:intro}

This is a citation \cite{Schumm2018}. And another citation is here \cite{Neumann2021}

As seen in the Figure \ref{fig:methods_scenarios}, the cross-reference works.
