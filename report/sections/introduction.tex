The global energy environment is experiencing fundamental upheaval, driven by the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a low-carbon future. In this context, hydrogen has emerged as a viable clean energy carrier capable of addressing the issues of decarbonizing numerous sectors such as industry, transportation, and power generation. A rising number of countries are investigating green hydrogen generation and use as a crucial component of their strategy to cut greenhouse gas emissions and meet ambitious climate targets.

Simultaneously, several countries are positioning themselves as potential exporters of green hydrogen, seeing an opportunity to leverage on their renewable energy resources and technological advances. These countries are expected to play a significant role in the global energy market by supplying clean hydrogen and therefore contributing to global decarbonization efforts. However, pursuing both hydrogen export and national energy transition poses complex problems and trade-offs that must be carefully considered.

Morocco is an excellent case study for managing these complexities. Morocco, which has vast solar and wind resources \cite{Peters2023, Touili2018, Sterl2022}, has set ambitious renewable energy adoption objectives, displaying a commitment to lowering its own greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, the country is strategically positioned to use its excess renewable energy to create and export green hydrogen, opening the door to substantial economic opportunities (and local value chains \cite{Ersoy2022}). %https://www.giz.de/de/downloads/giz2012-en-solar-plan-morocco.pdf

Furthermore, the country is a net importer of energy \cite{IEA2022}, and green hydrogen could help reduce its dependency on energy imports. The proximity to Europe, which is expected to be a major hydrogen importer, makes Morocco an attractive potential exporter. 

These conditions have prompted researchers \cite{Wijk2021, AbouSeada2022, Zwaan2021, Schellekens2010, Cavana2021, Touili2022, Timmerberg2019, Sens2022} to examine the potential of hydrogen in Africa and potential synergies with European demand. A more detailed study of Morocco has been undertaken by \cite{Boulakhbar2020} examining challenges in integrating renewables, \cite{Khouya2020} determining the Levelized Cost of Hydrogen based on CSP and wind farms, and \cite{Touili2018} investigating the potential of hydrogen from solar energy. \cite{Hampp2021} investigates various PtX products and their transportation to Europe, and \cite{Eichhammer2019} highlights diverse opportunities and challenges related to exporting hydrogen and PtX from Morocco.

While several studies have examined the potential of hydrogen as a low-carbon energy carrier \cite{Hampp2021, AbouSeada2022, Wijk2021} and others have explored various countries' climate targets and aspirations \cite{Boulakhbar2020}, a significant research gap remains regarding the complete integration of both perspectives. A critical analysis of the available literature indicates that numerous studies focus exclusively on either hydrogen potentials or climate ambitions, without discussing the complex relationship between these two critical aspects.

This research paper aims to thoroughly investigate the synergies and conflicts that arise from Morocco's dual goals of hydrogen export and national energy transition. To simulate a variety of scenarios, we use a fully sector-coupled capacity expansion and dispatch model of Morocco, which includes both gas and electricity networks. Shortcomings of studies on highly renewable energy systems in Africa as low temporal and spatial resolutions as well as the lack of sector-coupled energy as pointed out in \cite{Oyewo2023} are tackled in this study.

By examining various hydrogen export volumes and climate targets, we evaluate the potential impact of hydrogen exports on the economic welfare of both hydrogen-exporting nations and the local Moroccan population and businesses. (We explore the intricacies of technology lock-in, land use implications, and the potential risks of neo-colonialism \cite{HabeckEnergieimperialismus, TerraponPfaff2019, Hanger2016}, providing a comprehensive overview of the challenges and opportunities that emerge while pursuing these dual objectives.)

Our analysis of Morocco's energy system contributes to the expanding research that aims to inform policymaking and decision-making regarding sustainable energy transitions. Our study provides valuable insights into the pathways that can unlock synergies and reduce conflicts between hydrogen exports and internal decarbonization, enabling Morocco and other potential exporting regions to follow a harmonious and sustainable trajectory while facing similar energy dilemmas.





\subsection{Hydrogen export strategy and climate targets}
\label{subsec:policyandtargets}
Morocco has implemented various strategies and policies to reach its climate targets and promote hydrogen exports. These include programs on the expansion of RE, the development of hydrogen for local demands and exports as well as climate targets.
Renewable energy potential and national policy directions for sustainable development in Morocco \cite{Kousksou2015}


\subsubsection{Moroccan Hydrogen Strategy}
Figure \ref{fig:mar_hydrogen_strategy} shows the hydrogen strategy of Morocco, including
national (ammonia, hydrogen) and export demands (synfuels, hydrogen).
By 2030, the total hydrogen demand adds up to 13.5 TWh (2040: 58 TWh, 2050: 151 TWh), 
clearly listing higher demands for export than for local use. The hydrogen generation is backed by 5.2 GW of RE in 2030, 23 GW in 2040 and 55 GW in 2050 [Source: TBD].

\subsubsection{Climate targets}
In addition to the hydrogen strategy, Morocco has obliged to climate targets.
Figure \ref{fig:morocco_em} displays the historical emissions and targets of Morocco.
According to the self-defined national climate pledges under the Paris Agreement (NDC's), Morocco aims to limit historically rising GHG emissions to 75 MtCO2e (conditional) respectively 115 MtCO2e (unconditional) excluding LULUCF by 2030 \cite{CAT2021}. 
As stated in \cite{CAT2021}, Morocco has not yet submitted a net-zero target. (Further source on NDCs: https://www.iges.or.jp/en/pub/iges-indc-ndc-database/en )
TBD: A GHGe reduction of 32 \% by 2030 is mentioned in \cite[5]{Boulakhbar2020}, check that.

\subsubsection{Synergies and conflicts}
Both the hydrogen export strategy and climate targets imply a significant expansion of RE capacities. Furthermore, both strategies require a significant energy infrastructure development of e.g. electricity grid, hydrogen pipelines, CO2 network, ports and a significant scale-up of electrolysers.
Limited resources (e.g. land availability, renewable potentials, workforce, capital) require careful planning to minimize conflicts and maximize possible synergies.
