From big to small
\begin{itemize}
    \item Why is this research important? Climate change, COP27, hydrogen, local decarbonization, combined efforts (assets: especially with scarcity of electrolyzer capacity, we should use them better)
    \item What is the aim?
    \item What are the results?
\end{itemize}

Research questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What is the effect on cost and emissions (and potentials) if we consider the local energy system (electrolysis integrated or islanded)? (What are the benefits (wealth) for Morocco?)
    \item Does ongrid integration avoid installing excess RES and El capacity? (Ruhnau2022) -> Yes
    \item Emissions?
    \item Land use: competing RE potential resources?
    \item The role of green/grey hydrogen?
\end{itemize}
