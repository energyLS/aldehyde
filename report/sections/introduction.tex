The global energy environment is experiencing fundamental upheaval, driven by the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a low-carbon future. In this context, hydrogen has emerged as a viable clean energy carrier capable of addressing the issues of decarbonizing numerous sectors such as industry, transport, and power generation. A growing number of countries are investigating green hydrogen production and use as a crucial component of their strategy to cut greenhouse gas emissions and meet ambitious climate targets.

Simultaneously, several countries are positioning themselves as potential exporters of green hydrogen, seeing an opportunity to leverage on their renewable energy resources and technological advances [TBD: add examples]. These countries are expected to play a significant role in the global energy market by supplying clean hydrogen and therefore contributing to global decarbonization efforts. However, pursuing both hydrogen export and national energy transition poses complex problems and trade-offs that require careful consideration.

Morocco serves as a blueprint for investigating these dependencies. Morocco, which has vast solar and wind resources \cite{Peters2023, Touili2018, Sterl2022}, has proposed ambitious renewable energy adoption objectives, displaying a commitment to lowering its own greenhouse gas emissions [TBD: add source]. At the same time, the country is strategically positioned to use its excess renewable energy to create and export green hydrogen, opening the door to substantial economic opportunities (and local value chains \cite{Ersoy2022}). Furthermore, the country is a net importer of energy \cite{IEA2022}, and green hydrogen could help reduce its dependency on energy imports. The proximity to Europe, which is expected to be a major hydrogen importer, makes Morocco an attractive potential exporter. %https://www.giz.de/de/downloads/giz2012-en-solar-plan-morocco.pdf

These conditions are the motivation of several studies \cite{Wijk2021, AbouSeada2022, Zwaan2021, Schellekens2010, Cavana2021, Touili2022, Timmerberg2019, Sens2022} examining the potential of hydrogen in Africa and synergies with European demand. A more detailed study of Morocco has been undertaken by \cite{Boulakhbar2020} examining challenges in integrating renewables, \cite{Khouya2020} determining the Levelized Cost of Hydrogen based on CSP and wind farms, and \cite{Touili2018} investigating the potential of hydrogen from solar energy. \cite{Hampp2021} investigates various PtX products and their transportation to Europe, and \cite{Eichhammer2019} highlights diverse opportunities and challenges related to exporting hydrogen and PtX from Morocco. While several studies have examined the potential of hydrogen as a low-carbon energy carrier \cite{Hampp2021, AbouSeada2022, Wijk2021} and others have explored various countries' climate targets and aspirations \cite{Boulakhbar2020}, a significant research gap remains regarding the complete integration of both perspectives. The literature review indicates that numerous studies focus exclusively on either hydrogen potentials or climate ambitions, without discussing the complex relationship between these two critical aspects.

This research paper aims to investigate the synergies and conflicts that arise from Morocco's dual goals of hydrogen export and national energy transition. To simulate and otimize a variety of scenarios, we use a fully sector-coupled capacity expansion and dispatch model of Morocco, which includes both gas pipelines and electricity networks.
Shortcomings of studies on highly renewable energy systems in Africa as low temporal and spatial resolutions as well as the lack of sector-coupled energy as pointed out in \cite{Oyewo2023} are tackled in this study.

By examining various hydrogen export volumes and climate targets, we evaluate the potential impact of hydrogen exports on the economic welfare and benefits of both the hydrogen export industry and the local Moroccan population and businesses. (We explore the intricacies of technology lock-in, local energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, rising local energy prices, land use implications and neo-colonialism \cite{HabeckEnergieimperialismus, TerraponPfaff2019, Hanger2016}, providing a comprehensive overview of the challenges and opportunities that emerge while pursuing these dual objectives.

The analysis of Morocco's energy system contributes to the expanding research that aims to inform policymaking and decision-making regarding sustainable energy transitions. This study provides valuable insights into the pathways that can unlock synergies and reduce conflicts between hydrogen exports and internal decarbonization, enabling Morocco and other potential exporting regions to follow a harmonious and sustainable trajectory while facing similar energy system planning challenges.
