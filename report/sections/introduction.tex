\subsection{Ideas}
From big to small:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Why is this research important? Climate change, COP27, hydrogen, local decarbonization, combined efforts (assets: especially with scarcity of electrolyzer capacity, we should use them better)
    \item What is the aim?
    \item What are the results?
\end{itemize}
Narrative: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Security of supply/economic growth/cheap energy for North Africa and Morocco
    \item Fair cooperation and partnerships by: including local energy demands, investigation of conflicts/synergies
    \item Best locations with high FLH should not be reserved for export (as done in Global PtX Atlas)
    \item EU can rely on cost-effective green hydrogen
\end{itemize}

Details on benefits for MAR:
\begin{itemize}
    \item MAR is ramping up hydrogen strategy
    \item MAR is a net importer of energy (Currently importing 90 \%), could become exporter
    \item Local production of RE plants possible, as stated in \cite{Ersoy2022}
    \item Avoid "gr{\"u}ner Energie-Imperialismus" (Habeck: when visiting Namibia ) \cite{HabeckEnergieimperialismus}
\end{itemize}

Current cooperations/business:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Indias role: https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2023/02/353972/indias-renew-energy-global-eyes-moroccos-green-hydrogen-market
    \item TBD: Investigation of EU/Germany involvement in MAR?
\end{itemize}


Research questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Are there wealth, cost and emission benefits of an integrated optimisation compared to separated analyses?
    \item Are there competing RE potential resources and where are they located? Should these resources used for local decarbonization or for export purposes?
    \item What is the role of green/grey hydrogen?   
    \item Does ongrid integration avoid installing excess RES and El capacity? (That's a finding of e.g. \cite{Ruhnau2022})
    \item What are the conflicts and benefits of national transition and hydrogen export?
\end{itemize}

Literature research:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Local energy demand considered in: MenaFuels and \cite{Hampp2021}. According to MenaFuels the local demand is usually just some percentages of the potential
    \item TBD: Literature on similar topics 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Policy and climate targets}
Morocco has implemented various strategies and policies to reach its climate targets and hydrogen exports. 

\subsubsection{Moroccan RE Strategy}
See \cite[p. 13]{Ersoy2022} for a good overview of the Moroccan RE strategy.
"Moroccan Solar Plan" initiated in 2009 according to \cite[p. 2]{Boulakhbar2020}
Moroccan wind energy program: 2000 MW in 2020 and 2600 in 2030 \cite[p. 4]{Boulakhbar2020}

\subsubsection{Moroccan Hydrogen Strategy}
See \cite[p. 14]{Ersoy2022} for a good overview of the Moroccan Hydrogen strategy. Figure \ref{fig:mar_hydrogen_strategy} shows the hydrogen strategy of Morocco.

Details:
\begin{itemize}
    \item capacities of RE: 2030: 5.2 GW, 2040: 23 GW, 2050: 55 GW (only for H2? Include in Figure \ref{fig:mar_hydrogen_strategy}?)
    \item Cooperation between port authorities in Tanger Med and Hamburg
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Climate targets}
Describe the emission targets of Morocco. In general: Low per capita emissions
Depicted in Figure \ref{fig:morocco_em}.
A GHGe reduction of 32 \% by 2030 is mentioned in \cite[5]{Boulakhbar2020}
NDCs: https://www.iges.or.jp/en/pub/iges-indc-ndc-database/en 
Insights from \cite{CAT2021}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item No net-zero target.
    \item 2030: 115 MtCO2e (NDC, excluding LULUCF, Unconditional target)
    \item 2030: 75 MtCO2e (NDC, excluding LULUCF, Conditional target)
    \item 2030: 52\% Renewable energy share in installed electric capacity
\end{itemize}
