In this section we focus on the synergies and conflicts of hydro gen export and national energy transition. First, the
hydrogen and electricity prices of the integrated optimisation are analyzed in Section \ref{subsec:results_prices} along the two-dimensional scenario space presented in Section \ref{subsec:scenarios}. Based on these prices, Section \ref{subsec:economic_benefits} derives the total expenses of electricity and hydrogen and outlines economics benefits. Section \ref{subsec:integration_challenges} points out arising integration challenges (graphs in appendix, explaination in Section \ref{subsec:results_prices}?). The sensitivity analysis in Section \ref{subsec:sensitivity} examines key parameters and their influence on the main results.


\subsection{Hydrogen and electricity prices}
\label{subsec:results_prices}

Both the electricity and hydrogen prices are derived from the nodal power balance constraint, representing the prices in a "perfect" market \cite{Zeyen2022}.
In a second step, these temporally and spatially resolved prices are weighted based on different consumptions in hourly resolution to obtain a uniform, weighted marginal price of hydrogen/electricity of Morocco in each scenario.

The hourly-resoluted consumptions on which the weighting is based on differ in:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item electricity consumption on each node ($\rightarrow$ electricity prices everyone sees: "Export-Local-Average"),
    \item hydrogen consumption on each node ($\rightarrow$ hydrogen prices everyone sees: "Export-Local-Average"),
    \item electricity demand of electrolysers on each node ($\rightarrow$ electricity prices which electrolysers see: "Export-orientated") and
    \item electricity demand of all consumers except electrolysers ($\rightarrow$ electricity prices which local consumers see: "Local-orientated").
\end{enumerate}

These various types of weighted marginal prices are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:marginal_prices}. All four subfigures are based on the same scenarios which varies the hydrogen export volume from 0 - 200 TWh, and the emission reduction between 0 - 100\% resulting in 110 optimisation results per subfigure (cf. Sec. \ref{subsec:scenarios}).

The Export-Local-Average electricity price (s. Fig. \ref{fig:export_local_el_price}):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Low prices at emissions below 20\%
    \item Increasing electricity prices up to $60$--$70$\%, then decreasing electricity prices (Battery kicking in and smoothing el prices?)
    \item When hydrogen export is above 1.5 fold of local electricity demand, the price decrease flattens out
    \item Synergy in top right corner at high reduction and high export: lower prices here 
\end{itemize}

The Export-Local-Average hydrogen price (s. Fig. \ref{fig:export_local_hy_price}):
\begin{itemize}
    \item More export $\rightarrow$ higher prices
    \item At 70-90\% reduction
\end{itemize}

The Local-orientated electricity price (s. Fig. \ref{fig:local_el_price}):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Low prices at emissions below 20\%, then increasing prices along the climate ambition dimension
\end{itemize}

The Export-orientated electricity price (s. Fig. \ref{fig:export_el_price}):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Opposite to local orientated electricity price: decrease of prices seen by electrolysers when increasing climate ambition. especially low at no export and 60-70\% reduction, then increasing again
\end{itemize}


Conclusions from these results:
\begin{itemize}
    \item at higher climate ambitions, the electricity prices for households increase but decrease for the export orientated electrolysers
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Economic benefits for local consumers and exporting industry}
\label{subsec:economic_benefits}
Derived from the Figure \ref{fig:marginal_prices}, Figure \ref{fig:pricecut} disregards the export dimension and shows the weighted electricity prices for local consumers, electrolysers and average prices at an export volume of 100~TWh. It shows that at low emission reductions ($0$--$10$\%), both the prices for local consumers and electrolysers rise from $40$~\euro/MWh to approx. $50$~\euro/MWh. The higher the emission reduction from $10$\% onwards, the more both prices diverge. At high climate ambitions ($90$\%), the electricity price for local consumers is at $78$~\euro/MWh; $47$\% higher than the electricity price for electrolysers ($53$~\euro/MWh).

The observed difference in weighted prices results from the operation of the energy system: The (non-weighted) price of electricity is cheaper when the electrolysers are running and more expensive when local industry and households are consuming electricity.
\begin{itemize}
    \item TBD: Why does this effect amplify at higher climate ambition?
    \item TBD: Reason could be: at 100 TWh hydrogen export, the export demand dominates hence from a total system cost it makes sense to favour electrolysers. BUT: at lower export volumes, this effect is even more pronounced.
    \item Visualize: AC prices heatmap, electrolyser heatmap, local demand heatmap. $\rightarrow$ the higher the climate ambition, the higher the correlation between AC prices and electrolysers should be
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}



\subsection{Integration challenges}
\label{subsec:integration_challenges}
Figure \ref{fig:diurnal} shows the diurnal residual load (electricity load minus solar PV and wind power generation) at 0 export and 0 - 90\% emission reduction. At high emission reductions, a high penetration of RE generation (especially solar PV) leads to negative residual load at noon imposing great system integration challenges.
These challenges are (partly) tackled by the expansion of battery storage and increasing curtailment rates of onshore wind and solar PV (s. Fig. \ref{fig:integration_options}) at emission reductions up to $70$\%. At an even higher reduction of $90$\%, the electrolysers operating in a diurnal patterns reduce the negative residual loads significantly as shown in Figure \ref{fig:diurnal_exportdim}. This effect is even more pronounced at higher export levels as displayed in \ref{fig:diurnal_exportdim}. 
Figure \ref{fig:integration_options} reveals that at increasing hydrogen export and high emission reduction (above $70$\%) both battery storage and curtailment are reduced, due to the synergy with export driven hydrogen infrastructure and it's ability to integrate RE at large scale. This synergy is also displayed in Figure \ref{fig:export_local_el_price}, reflecting lower average electricity prices at high reduction and high export.
\begin{itemize}
    \item TBD: Too many figure references, confusing for the reader.
    \item TBD: To a certain extend, this is an explaination also for other sections. Maybe integrate it there?
\end{itemize}

    \label{fig:diurnal}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Storage requirements}
Figure \ref{fig:integration_options} shows the installed capacities of battery and hydrogen storages. Both installations show a clear correlation with either the climate ambition or the export dimension. With higher climate ambitions, battery storages are deployment in larger scale at 60\% $CO_2$ reduction and above, balancing the integration of variable REs (esp. solar PV). The hydrogen (underground) storages are deployed along the export dimension to buffer the hydrogen generation to meet the constant hydrogen export demand. At high climate ambition, the installed battery capacity reduces with higher export since the hydrogen storage additionally buffers daily generation patterns of Solar PV (TBD: Proof that).


\subsection{Sensitivity analysis}
\label{subsec:sensitivity}
Figure XX shows the sensitivity to exogenous parameters (WACC, technology cost, temporal resolution) (TBD).

No battery storage:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Slightly more hydrogen storage
    \item Lower capacity factor of electrolysers at low co2 reductions
    \item More curtailment at low co2 reductions and high export (massive wind curtailment $\rightarrow$ Due to green hydrogen constraint? Why is there so much excess wind?)
\end{itemize}

Sensitivity analysis on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)
    \item Technology cost
    \item Hourly resolution
    \item Battery storage vs no battery storage
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Coal power supply/Electricity generation}
How does it change? Maybe good and easy first results Section?
Super interesting: At low climate ambition effort, coal gets phased out by high exports only! (Make sure, this is not partly triggered by greenness constraint). Strong message: Green hydrogen export also decarbonizes electricity system on the go! Or rather: is replaced by ocgt
