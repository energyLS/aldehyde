    \label{fig:LCOH}
\end{figure}

As depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:LCOH}, the cost of hydrogen is lower in the islanded scenario due to best potentials and no transport included (export 10 TWh)?


\subsection{Total system cost}

\subsection{Spatial analysis of (competing) RE resources}
Both the islanded systems and the Moroccan energy system have the same land resources available. 
The optimal solutions for both optimisations rely on the same land resources, in combination exceeding the 
available resources in some regions (s. Fig. \ref{fig:land_conflicts}). 
Similar to Europe/Germany, public acceptance of Renewable Energies have to be taken in account. 
They are not unlimited, as discussed in \cite{Hanger2016} and \cite{TerraponPfaff2019}.
Paper on competing land resources can be found here \cite{Patankar2022}

\subsection{Carbon intensity}
Bullet points
\begin{itemize}
    \item What is the carbon intensity for export and local consumption of the islanded scenario? 
    \item What is the carbon intensity of the integrated scenario?
    \item Compare with blue hydrogen (1 kgCO2/kgH2) and EU threshold for low-carbon gas (3 kgCO2/kgH2)
    \item Differnce between 2030 and 2050?
\end{itemize}
