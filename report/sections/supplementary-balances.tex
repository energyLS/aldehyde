\subsection{Oil balance}
\label{subsec:oil-balance}
Figure \ref{fig:oil-balance} shows the oil balance at 1 TWh/a export at increasing domestic climate change mitigation.

    \caption{Oil balance at 1 TWh/a export at increasing domestic climate change mitigation. The exogenously defined oil demand for land transport substantially decreases due to electrification, whereas oil demands for industrial naphta, aviation, agriculture are constant. The demand is met by fossil oil up to 80\% climate change mitigation, then gradually replaced by Fischer-Tropsch fuels.}
