% Is the research Q adressed?
Our study shows the importance of integrated scenario analysis among hydrogen exports, domestic mitigation and hydrogen regulation.
% What are the main results?
Both hydrogen exports and domestic mitigation offer co-benefits mainly at medium mitigation (40--60\%) and moderate to high hydrogen exports (25--120 TWh). Hydrogen regulation via temporal matching is a decisive instrument
to protect domestic consumers. Hourly matching decreases the cost for domestic electricity consumers (up to -31\%) while the effect on hydrogen exports is minimal. Hydrogen regulation can effectively hedge domestic electricity consumers against rising prices across mitigation and export scenarios. %Furthermore, these redistribution effects are less pronounced in countries with a high share of renewable electricity.

% High level
This study contributes to the investigation of 
implications and benefits of hydrogen exports for domestic electricity consumers. Even though hydrogen regulation hedges domestic electricity consumers against rising prices, further implications of hydrogen exporters on the domestic population (land use, competing RE resources, environmental concerns of desalination) can not be excluded within the scope of this study.

In summary, our study underscores that hydrogen export ambitions, as encouraged by entities like the European Union, is in favor of domestic electricity consumers 
if the appropriate hydrogen regulation is in place. A proactive and comprehensive transition strategy, considering the interplay between hydrogen exports and domestic mitigation, is key to unlocking economic opportunities for both hydrogen exporters and the domestic population. 
Apart from reducing greenhouse gas emissions, hydrogen regulation is a decisive policy instrument in steering the welfare (re-)distribution between hydrogen exporters and domestic electricity consumers. 
This balance is crucial for a sustainable energy transition in Morocco and offers valuable insights for further countries facing similar energy challenges globally.
