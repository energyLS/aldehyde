\begin{itemize}
    \item Summary of key findings and insights from the analysis
    \item Implications for other countries facing similar tensions between hydrogen exports and energy transition
    \item Call for further research and policy implementation
    \item Final remarks on the importance of a holistic approach to sustainable energy strategies
\end{itemize}

From small to big:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What are the results, what has been shown? $\rightarrow$ key takeaways
    \item What is the answer to the research question: Is it beneficial (total system cost, lcoh, lcoe, emissions)
    to (simultaneously) push the national energy transition
    and hydrogen export (synergies and conflicts)?
    \item Why is this research important? Climate change, COP27, hydrogen, local decarbonization, combined efforts (assets: especially with scarcity of electrolyzer capacity, we should use them better)
    \item Policy recommendations
\end{itemize}
