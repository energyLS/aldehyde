\label{sec:system-overview}

Figure \ref{fig:system-overview} shows the system overview of the applied model as presented in Abdel-Khalek et al. \cite{Abdel-Khalek2024}. The sector-coupled model includes various energy carriers (liquid fossil, biomass, heat, electricity, hydrogen and natural gas), multiple sectors and network infrastructure (power transmission lines, hydrogen pipelines and natural gas network)\cite{Abdel-Khalek2024}.
