\begin{itemize}
    \item Identification of conflicts and synergies between hydrogen exports and energy transition
    \item Implications for renewable energy deployment
    \item Land use competition and its consequences
    \item Potential risks of neo-colonialism and their significance
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Land use}
Avoid Neo-colonialism. Best potentials should not be reserved for export.

\subsection{Synergy maximizing time path}

\subsection{Limitations}
\label{subsec:limitations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Only energy carrier hydrogen
    \item System boundary: borders of Morocco. Did not investigate transport as in \cite{Hampp2021}, \cite{Galimova2023}
    \item No endogenous learning as in \cite{Zeyen2023}
    \item Did not investigate material needs as in \cite{Wang2023}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comparison with other studies}
E.g. compare to \cite{Hampp2021} and their cost of electricity

\subsection{Further research}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Transport options
    \item Include other countries (But focus is Morocco)
    \item Include other costs
\end{itemize}
