\begin{itemize}
    \item Identification of conflicts and synergies between hydrogen exports and energy transition
    \item Implications for renewable energy deployment
    \item Land use competition and its consequences
    \item Potential risks of neo-colonialism and their significance
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Synergies}
Ideas:
\begin{itemize}
    \item High export and high climate ambition leads to synergies (lower electricity prices)
    \item Export profits from high climate ambition: hydrogen export gets cheaper at >70\% CO2 reduction (s. Fig. \ref{fig:export_local_hy_price})
    \item 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Synergy maximizing time path}
Ideas:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can we draw a "time path"? Or is this not valid since it is all 2030/2038 scenarios? Should we include a time dimension in the climate ambition dimension?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conflicts}
Ideas:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Avoid high electricity prices at 60\% reduction and low export, rather go for higher export there
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Neo-colonial Implications}
Ideas:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Danger: Avoid Neo-colonialism (Export industry fostered by EU etc. has a significant impact)
    \item Increasing electricity prices for local consumers? Driven by climate ambition, not by export. Rather synergy at high export and high climate ambition, decreasing electricity prices for local consumers
    \item Land use: The best potentials should not be reserved for export
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Integrated policies for synergy and fairness}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tax hydrogen electricity price? They get the cheaper electricity prices at least. Ensure equitable economic distribution
    \item Land use policies?
    \item Aligning hydrogen export goals with renewable energy targets/climate targets 
    \item Mitigating risks of neo-colonialism through responsible practices
\end{itemize}





\subsection{Limitations}
\label{subsec:limitations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Only export energy carrier: hydrogen
    \item System boundary: borders of Morocco. Did not investigate transport as in \cite{Hampp2021}, \cite{Galimova2023}
    \item No endogenous learning as in \cite{Zeyen2023}
    \item Did not investigate material needs as in \cite{Wang2023}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comparison with other studies}
E.g. compare to \cite{Hampp2021} and their cost of electricity

\subsection{Further research}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Transport options
    \item Include other countries (But focus is Morocco)
    \item Include other costs
\end{itemize}
