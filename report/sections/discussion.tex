% \subsection{Synergies and conflicts}
% \label{subsec:synergies-conflicts}
% Results from Chapter \ref{sec:results} indicate various synergies and conflicts of hydrogen export and national energy transition. The price of electricity highly depends on the climate ambition and hydrogen export volume, e.g. increasing the costs of electricity for local demands at medium climate ambition (60\%) and high export volumes (150 - 200 TWh). On the other hand, the green hydrogen constraint requiring the installation of renewable energies according to the hydrogen exports hedges local electricity consumers against higher electricity prices at lower climate ambitions. If such a constraint is not imposed on the hydrogen electrolysis, hydrogen exporters benefit from lower hydrogen prices.

% The electricity price increase flattens out at high climate ambitions, meaning local electricity consumers are able to avoid high economic burdens imposed by a hydrogen infrastructure in these scenarios.

% The hydrogen prices increase with hydrogen exports across all climate ambition scenarios. Nonetheless, the increase is less significant when the local energy system relies already on substantial amounts of hydrogen and Fischer-Tropsch products. The price of hydrogen for export is lowest when the local energy transition is still in the early stages and the export volumes are low -- electrolysers can run at high capacity factors paying of high upfront capital costs. 




\subsection{Synergy maximizing time path}
\label{subsec:timepath}
All scenarios investigated in this study are based on the year 2030 as reasoned in Chapter \ref{sec:methods}. The transition towards climate neutrality of Moroccos energy system or the ramping up of exports up to 200 TWh/a are a matter of decade(s) and undergoes a certain pathway. Based on the co-benefits identified in Section \ref{subsec:benefits}, steering the transition by minimizing conflicts and maximizing/amplifying co-benefits reduce both the price of electricity and price of hydrogen. 

To provide policy recommendations, we present three possible pathways of reaching the aims of hydrogen exports and domestic mitigation as displayed in Figure \ref{fig:expenses_default}.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Quick exports and slow mitigation}: Reaching high export levels before adequately mitigating domestic emissions leads to higher total emissions, if no strict hydrogen regulation is in place. Instead, hourly matching reduces domestic electricity cost effectively and redistributes welfare from exporters to domestic consumers. Hydrogen regulation plays a decisive role in this pathway.
    \item \textbf{Balanced exports and mitigation}: A medium (or balanced) transition towards both exports and mitigation offer benefits for both domestic electricity consumers and hydrogen exporters. Domestic electricity consumers experience a short phase of higher prices (10\% mitigation and 20 TWh export), but are then rewarded towards higher export levels given strict hydrogen regulation.
    \item \textbf{Slow exports and quick mitigation} A shift of transition speed towards domestic mitigation imposes increasing cost for hydrogen exporters, while the effect of exports on domestic electricity cost is marginal. The hydrogen regulation plays only a minor role in this pathway, as concluded in Section \ref{subsec:rule_all}.
\end{enumerate}

The three illustrative pathways offer certain room for manoeuvre in policy-making. However, these pathways do not reflect other constraints as limited renewable energy ramp-up rates, the availability of workforce and bureaucratic hurdles among others. An holistic approach and well-balanced policies is required to steer the energy transition and export ambitions.


\subsection{Balancing interests of exporters and domestic demand}
\label{subsec:balancedinterests}
The implications of hydrogen export on domestic electricity consumers mentioned in Chapter \ref{sec:intro} are reflected in various dimensions. 

First, the price of electricity for domestic businesses and households need to be considered to enable a fair discussion and balance of burdens and opportunities. This study shows that the price of electricity highly depends on hydrogen export volumes and hydrogen regulation. The export of hydrogen in combination with strict hydrogen regulation provides the opportunity of decreasing electricity prices, providing opportunities for local businesses and households.

Second, the significant deployment of solar PV and onshore wind comes along with a substantial land use. Several studies \cite{Terrapon-Pfaff2019, Hanger2016} highlight the requirement of local acceptance of renewable energies in Morocco. From a German/European perspective, hydrogen imports are not necessarily the most economic option \cite{Merten2023} but also provide a way out of having to deal with national acceptance of renewable energies in Germany/Europe.
Shifting such issues of acceptance to Morocco by deploying renewable energy and scaling up their hydrogen exports raises moral questions and should be dealt with carefully. %TBD: Desertec: why did it fail.

Third, this study shows the benefits of integrating solar PV and onshore wind into the main grid for both domestic electricity consumers and hydrogen exporters. By integrating the best sites of solar PV and onshore wind, domestic electricity consumers can access the cost-cutting potentials and benefit from lower electricity prices as shown in our results (s. Sec. \ref{sec:results}). On the other hand, off-grid hydrogen generation reserves the promising electricity potentials for hydrogen export only. Nonetheless, \cite{Tries2023b} shows the benefits of hydrogen islanding, offering cost savings for inverters and benefits for power quality. Domestic consumers may profit from these economic opportunities for hydrogen exporters indirectly through corresponding policies.

Hydrogen export ambitions (fostered by e.g. the EU) do not cause disadvantages for the local population \textit{per se}, a proactive transition taking into account the interplay of domestic electricity prices unleashes economic opportunities for both exporters and local population.

% Ideas:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Danger: Avoid Neo-colonialism (Export industry fostered by EU etc. has a significant impact)
%     \item Increasing electricity prices for local consumers? Driven by climate ambition, not by export. Rather synergy at high export and high climate ambition, decreasing electricity prices for local consumers
%     \item Land use: The best potentials should not be reserved for export
%     \item Land use competition and its consequences
%     \item Potential risks of neo-colonialism and their significance
% \end{itemize}


% The demand of hydrogen and derivatives to decarbonize the e.g. European energy system imposes the danger of neglecting local needs and prerequisites in Morocco. Various studies are lacking [TBD: Add studies] sufficient attention to Moroccos energy system and oversimplify the multi-dimensional task of scaling up hydrogen exports. 
% By integrating and fully considering Moroccos energy system, this study identifies resulting p


% \subsection{Integrated policies for synergy and fairness}
% \label{subsec:fairness}

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Tax hydrogen electricity price? They get the cheaper electricity prices at least. Ensure equitable economic distribution
%     \item Land use policies?
%     \item Aligning hydrogen export goals with renewable energy targets/climate targets 
%     \item Mitigating risks of neo-colonialism through responsible practices
% \end{itemize}



\subsection{Limitations}
\label{subsec:limitations}

The sector-coupled energy model as well as the results underly certain limitations. 

In this study, we leave the option open that the hydrogen for export is further synthesized to hydrogen derivatives as ammonia, Fischer-Tropsch products or sponge iron etc. We do not model the system operation of a further synthesis of export products explicitly, unlike we do for the domestic demands for hydrogen derivatives. Further synthesis of export products and linked transportation modes are investigated in \cite{Hampp2021}, \cite{Galimova2023} and \cite{Verpoort2023} but not in the scope of this study. Further synthesis for export products will likely have effects on the system operation, since the synthesis in combination with cheaper storage (e.g. oil storage are cheaper than H2 storage \cite{DEA2019TechnologyData}) might provide additional flexibility to a certain extent but is limited by the operation flexibility of Fischer-Tropsch or Haber-Bosch processes.

Additionally, the transition of certain sectors is not subject to the optimisation but exogenously defined. Such nodal shifts (e.g. in transport: share of electric vehicles) provide system benefits (e.g. Vehicle-to-Grid) for which an integrated optimisation favours e.g. higher shares of electric vehicles.
%[TBD: How does e.g. \cite{Neumann2022} justify it?].
Recent approaches as \cite{Zeyen2023} improve such caveats by incorporating endogenous learning, but research gaps on the endogenous demand of the transport sector remain.

National climate ambitions and especially the scale-up of hydrogen export require significant amounts of raw materials (copper, cement, ...) linked with resource limitations as well as upstream GHG emissions. As pointed out in \cite{Wang2023} in a global analysis, most raw material limitations required for electricity generation do not exceed geological reserves. However, material demands of e.g. electrolysers are not within the scope of \cite{Wang2023}.

The cost of water through desalination and transport has a 
has a single cost for the whole country. However, the transportation costs highly depend on the terrain as pointed out by \cite{Caldera2016}, hence the water costs are higher in more remote areas which is not taken into account in this study. In contrast, the effect of a higher spatial resolution of water costs is assumed to be minor, since the water desalination and transport costs do not contribute significantly to the cost of hydrogen as emphasized in \cite{Hampp2023}. %Also: Direct integration of REs to desalination is not considered
