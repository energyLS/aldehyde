\label{subsec:timepath}
The transition towards climate neutrality of Morocco's energy system and the ramping up of exports up to 120 TWh/a are a matter of decade(s) and undergo a certain pathway. Based on the co-benefits identified in \nameref{subsec:benefits}, steering the transition by minimizing conflicts and amplifying co-benefits potentially reduces both the price of electricity and price of hydrogen. 

The broad scenario design of this study allows conclusions and recommendations beyond the specific Morocco case.
Various potential hydrogen exporting countries with different prerequisite can be found in the integrated analysis of benefits and burdens for domestic electricity consumers and hydrogen exporters among the dimensions of domestic climate change mitigation, hydrogen export and hydrogen regulation.

Based on the main findings of co-benefits and temporal hydrogen regulation, we present three possible pathways of reaching the aims of hydrogen exports and domestic climate change mitigation complemented with tailored temporal hydrogen regulation recommendations:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Quick exports and slow climate change mitigation}: Reaching high export levels before adequately mitigating domestic emissions leads to higher total emissions, if no strict temporal hydrogen regulation is in place. Instead, hourly matching reduces domestic electricity cost effectively and redistributes welfare from exporters to domestic consumers. This regulation plays a decisive role in this pathway, even annual or monthly matching triggers the \textit{price spillover} and \textit{energy spillover} effects.
    \item \textbf{Balanced exports and climate change mitigation}: A medium (or balanced) transition of both exports and mitigation offers benefits for both domestic electricity consumers and hydrogen exporters. Domestic electricity consumers experience a short phase of higher prices (10\% climate change mitigation and 20 TWh/a export), but are then rewarded towards higher export levels given strict hourly temporal hydrogen regulation.
    \item \textbf{Slow exports and quick climate change mitigation}: If the transition speed of domestic climate change mitigation is quicker than the scale-up of hydrogen exports, this imposes increasing cost for hydrogen exporters, while the effect of exports on domestic electricity cost is marginal. The temporal hydrogen regulation plays only a minor role in this pathway, since the electricity system is already highly or fully renewable electricity based and neither \textit{price spillover} nor \textit{energy spillover} are effective.
\end{enumerate}

The three illustrative pathways offer certain room for manoeuvre in policy-making for various countries and their export ambitions as well as speed of domestic climate change mitigation. However, these pathways do not reflect additional constraints as limited renewable energy ramp-up rates, the availability of workforce, additional prerequisites such as an effective carbon pricing system for carbon-based Power-to-X products and bureaucratic hurdles among others. A holistic approach and well-balanced policies is required to steer the energy transition and export ambitions.


\subsection*{Balancing interests of exporters and domestic demand}
\label{subsec:balancedinterests}
The implications of hydrogen export on domestic electricity consumers are reflected in various dimensions. 

First, the price of electricity for domestic businesses and households need to be considered to enable a fair discussion and balance of burdens and opportunities. This study shows that the price of electricity highly depends on hydrogen export volumes and temporal hydrogen regulation. The export of hydrogen in combination with strict temporal hydrogen regulation provides the opportunity of decreasing domestic electricity prices, providing opportunities for domestic businesses and households.

Second, the substantial deployment of solar PV and onshore wind comes along with a substantial land use. Several studies \cite{Terrapon-Pfaff2019, Hanger2016} highlight the requirement of local acceptance of renewable energies in Morocco. From a German/European perspective, hydrogen imports are not necessarily the most economic option \cite{Merten2023} but also provide a way out of having to deal with the domestic acceptance of renewable energies.
Shifting such issues of acceptance to Morocco by deploying renewable energy and scaling up their hydrogen exports raises moral questions and should be dealt with carefully. %TBD: Desertec: why did it fail.

Third, this study shows the benefits of integrating solar PV and onshore wind into the main grid for both domestic electricity consumers and hydrogen exporters. By integrating the best sites of solar PV and onshore wind, domestic electricity consumers can access the cost-cutting potentials and benefit from lower electricity prices as shown in our results. On the other hand, off-grid hydrogen generation potentially reserves the promising electricity potentials for hydrogen export only. Nonetheless, Tries et al.\cite{Tries2023b} show the benefits of hydrogen islanding, offering cost savings for inverters and benefits for power quality. Domestic consumers may profit from these economic opportunities for hydrogen exporters indirectly through corresponding policies.

Hydrogen export ambitions (fostered by e.g. the European Union) do not cause disadvantages for the domestic population \textit{per se}, a proactive transition taking into account the interplay of domestic electricity prices unleashes economic opportunities for both exporters and domestic population.



\subsection*{Limitations}
\label{subsec:limitations}

The sector-coupled energy model as well as the results underly certain limitations. In this study, we leave the option open that the hydrogen for export is further synthesized to hydrogen derivatives as ammonia, Fischer-Tropsch products or sponge iron etc. We do not model the system operation of a further synthesis of export products explicitly, unlike we do for the domestic demands for hydrogen derivatives. Further synthesis of export products and linked transportation modes are investigated in Hampp et al.\cite{Hampp2023}, Galimova et al.\cite{Galimova2023} and Verpoort et al.\cite{Verpoort2023} but not in the scope of this study.

A further synthesis will likely have effects on the system operation, since the synthesis in combination with cheaper storage (e.g. oil storage is cheaper than hydrogen storage \cite{DEA2019TechnologyData}) provides an additional flexibility to a certain extent but is limited by the operation flexibility of Fischer-Tropsch or Haber-Bosch processes.

The constant hydrogen export demand assumed in this study represents pipeline operation or a further hydrogen synthesis.
If the export hydrogen is not further synthesized but exported as liquified hydrogen via shipping, there are significant impacts on the energy system to expect. The demand pattern of ship export (landing, loading, travel time) triggers spikes in hydrogen demand, which would need to be buffered by large-scale hydrogen storage or by a corresponding operation of hydrogen electrolysis. 


Additionally, the transition of certain sectors is not subject to the optimisation but exogenously defined. Such nodal shifts (e.g. in transport: share of electric vehicles) provide system benefits (e.g. Vehicle-to-Grid) for which an integrated optimisation favours e.g. higher shares of electric vehicles.
Recent approaches as Zeyen et al.\cite{Zeyen2023} improve such caveats by incorporating endogenous learning, but research gaps on the endogenous demand of the transport sector remain.

National climate ambitions and especially the scale-up of hydrogen export require substantial amounts of raw materials (e.g. copper, cement) linked with resource limitations as well as upstream greenhouse gas emissions. As pointed out in Wang et al.\cite{Wang2023} in a global analysis, most raw material limitations required for electricity generation do not exceed geological reserves. However, material demands of e.g. electrolysers are not within the scope of Wang et al.\cite{Wang2023}.

The cost of water through desalination and transport has a single cost for the whole country. However, the transportation costs highly depend on the terrain as pointed out by Caldera et al.\cite{Caldera2016}, hence the water costs are higher in more remote areas which is not taken into account in this study. In contrast, the effect of a higher spatial resolution of water costs is assumed to be minor, since the water desalination and transport costs do not contribute substantially to the cost of hydrogen as emphasized in Hampp et al.\cite{Hampp2023}.
