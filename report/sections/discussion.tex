\begin{itemize}
    \item Identification of conflicts and synergies between hydrogen exports and energy transition
    \item Implications for renewable energy deployment
    \item Land use competition and its consequences
    \item Potential risks of neo-colonialism and their significance
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Land use}
Avoid Neo-colonialism. Best potentials should not be reserved for export.

\subsection{Synergy maximizing time path}

\subsection{Limitations}
\label{subsec:limitations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Only energy carrier hydrogen
    \item System boundary: borders of Morocco
    \item Costs not prices (Martin Wietschel criticises that). But: I use marginal prices
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comparison with other studies}
E.g. compare to \cite{Hampp2021} and their cost of electricity

\subsection{Further research}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Transport options
    \item Include other countries (But focus is Morocco)
    \item Include other costs
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Further ideas}
List of ideas to discuss
\begin{itemize}
    \item Carbon intensity
    \item Implications for policymakers, investors, and other stakeholders
\end{itemize}
