As global demand for green hydrogen rises, potential hydrogen exporters move into the spotlight.
However, the large-scale installation of on-grid hydrogen electrolysis for export can have profound impacts on domestic energy prices, climate change mitigation and energy-related emissions.
Our investigation explores the interplay of hydrogen exports, domestic mitigation and temporal hydrogen regulation, employing a sector-coupled energy model in Morocco. 
We find substantial co-benefits of domestic mitigation and hydrogen exports, whereby exports can reduce domestic electricity prices while domestic mitigation efforts reduce hydrogen export prices.
However, increasing hydrogen exports quickly in a system that is still dominated by fossil fuels can substantially raise domestic electricity prices, if green hydrogen production is not regulated.
Surprisingly, temporal matching of hydrogen production lowers domestic electricity cost by up to 31\% while the effect on exporters is minimal. 
This policy instrument steers the welfare (re-)distribution between hydrogen exporting firms, hydrogen importers, and domestic electricity consumers and hereby increases acceptance among actors.

% Longer version of last points
% Surprisingly, temporal matching of hydrogen production can not only protect domestic consumers from high costs, but lower their electricity costs by up to 31\% in the scenarios while the effect on exporters is minimal.
% In addition, temporal hydrogen regulation is a decisive policy instrument in steering the welfare (re-)distribution between i) hydrogen exporting firms and hydrogen importing countries and ii) hydrogen exporting firms and domestic electricity consumers, while a fair balance can increase acceptance across actors.

% % Introduction/Background
% Several countries are emerging as future potential exporters of green hydrogen, while simultaneously pursuing their own ambitious energy transitions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
% The adoption of on-grid hydrogen electrolysis for export, reaching magnitudes multiple times of the domestic electricity demand, introduces the potential for profound impacts on both domestic electricity prices and energy balances.
% Vice versa, domestic mitigation and highly renewable electricity systems provide economic opportunities for hydrogen exporters.
% % Methods
% We explore the interactions between hydrogen exports, domestic mitigation and hydrogen regulation using a fully sector-coupled capacity expansion and dispatch model of Morocco across 14 regions, including integrated gas pipeline and electricity network planning based on PyPSA-Earth. The applied sector-coupled model simulates and optimises the Moroccan energy system in 484 scenarios at a 3-hourly temporal resolution, sweeping through different hydrogen export volumes, domestic  mitigation levels and hydrogen regulations.
% % Results
% Our results show co-beneﬁts of domesticmitigation and hydrogen export at medium mitigation (40 - 60\%) and moderate to high hydrogen exports (25 -- 150 TWh/a).
% In addition, we reveal hydrogen regulation via temporal matching as decisive instrument to steer economic redistributions between hydrogen exporters and domestic electricity consumers. 
% Hourly matching decreases the cost for domestic electricity (up to -31\%) and increases cost for hydrogen exports (up to 7\%) in high export and low mitigation scenarios.
% Our analysis across all three dimensions (export, mitigation, hydrogen regulation) shows the importance of strong hydrogen regulation in high export and low mitigation scenarios beyond the specific case of Morocco. 
% The redistribution effects of hydrogen regulation are less pronounced in countries with a high share of renewable electricity.
% % Conclusion & Broader Significance
% We reveal how hydrogen regulation can effectively hedge domestic electricity consumers against rising prices across mitigation and export scenarios.  Integrated policies unlock synergies, potentially increase domesticacceptance by reducing domestic electricity prices and counteract neo-colonialism implications of hydrogen exports.



% Old abstract
% Several countries are emerging as future potential exporters of green hydrogen, while simultaneously pursuing their own ambitious energy transitions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
% Morocco serves as a blueprint for countries aiming to design their energy systems along these two dimensions, risking technology lock-in, unabated domesticenergy-related greenhouse gas emissions, rising domesticenergy prices, land use implications and neo-colonialism. 
% Extending the current state of research, we conduct an integrated analysis of synergies and conflicts between these two objectives, taking into account the potential impact of hydrogen exports on economic benefits for both domesticpopulations and hydrogen exporters. We present a fully sector-coupled capacity expansion and dispatch model of Morocco across 14 regions, including integrated gas pipeline and electricity network planning based on PyPSA-Earth. The applied sector-coupled model simulates and optimises the Moroccan energy system in more than 100 scenarios at a 3-hourly temporal resolution, sweeping through different hydrogen export volumes and climate targets. 
% Results show that hydrogen exports could provide significant economic benefits for both hydrogen exporters and the domesticpopulation, but also create potential conflicts and rising electricity and hydrogen prices.
% In addition, potential risks of neo-colonialism highlight the need for an integrated assessment of hydrogen exports and domesticdecarbonization. Integrated policies unlock synergies and minimise potential conflicts between hydrogen exports and Morocco's energy transition, while ensuring social and environmental sustainability.
