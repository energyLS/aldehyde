Several countries are emerging on the world map as future potential exporters of green hydrogen, while simultaneously pursuing an ambitious energy transition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Morocco serves as a blueprint for countries operating in this area of tension, including technology lock-in, unabated local energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, land use implications and neo-colonialism. Extending the current state of research, we conduct an integrated analysis of synergies and conflicts between these two objectives, taking into account the potential impact of hydrogen exports on economic benefits for both local populations and hydrogen exporters. We present a fully sector-coupled capacity expansion and dispatch model of Morocco across 53 regions, including integrated gas and electricity network planning based on PyPSA-Earth. The model is used to simulate and optimise the Moroccan energy system in more than 100 scenarios at a 3-hourly time resolution, sweeping through different hydrogen export volumes and climate targets. The model results show that hydrogen exports could provide significant economic benefits for both hydrogen exporters and the local population, but also create potential conflicts with the country's renewable energy deployment and infrastructure, particularly in terms of competing demands for land use. In addition, potential risks of neo-colonialism highlight the need for an integrated assessment of hydrogen exports and local decarbonisation benefits. Integrated policies unlock synergies and minimise potential conflicts between hydrogen exports and Morocco's energy transition, while ensuring social and environmental sustainability.
